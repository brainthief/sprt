The MULTIGYM PLUS exercise bench is a versatile multi-functional hometraining unit for optimum fitness training with special emphasis on muscle-power. To ensure that your exercising is in keeping with your
general health, please read the following instructions and observe them at all times:

1. Newcomers should avoid using excessively heavy weights.
2. During start-up sessions, use weights that can used for 15 repetitions without gasping for breath.
3. Always breathe regularly: breath out when pushing against the load (concentric phase) and breath in when releasing it (eccentric phase). Avoid forced breathing.
4. Carry out all movements evenly and smoothly without jerking.
5. All movements should be carried out to their full extent to prevent contraction of the muscles. However, in the bending and stretching positions ensure that the muscles are tense enough to minimise strain
on the joints.
6. Pay particular attention to keeping your back in a stable position. To ensure this, keep the tension of the stomach muscles constant during exercising.
7. Always remember that your tendons and joints do not develop as quickly as your strength and muscle power.
For this reason, increase the load slowly in the course of your exercise program. Your training should therefore be increased gradually in the following

I. Increase the frequency of exercising (number of sessions per week)
II. Increase the amount of exercising (number of sets per exercise)
III. Increase the difficulty of the exercise (increase exercising weight).

__Important__ before beginning your training program, consult your doctor to ensure that you are fit enough to use the MULTIGYM PLUS power center. Base your program on the result of this medical examination. __The above mentioned and yet to follow training instructions are only suitable for healthy people.__

__Recommendation__

Exercises designed to increase strength and stamina and to build up muscle mass (hypertrophy exercising) are the most suitable types of exercise for improving general health and fitness. To improve stamina and
strength, you should exercise with lighter weights (approx. 40-50% of maximum force*) and the speed of movement should be fairly rapid but controlled. The number of repeats should be between 16 and 20.

For exercises designed to increase muscle mass, you should use heavier weights (approx. 60-80% of maximum force*) and the speed of movement should be fairly slow.

After about 4-6 weeks‘ strength and stamina training, a moderate program of exercising to increase muscle mass is possible. For older people in particular, it is important to maintain and increase muscle mass in
order to stabilise and relieve strain on the joints.

Sample plans for training:

Weeks 1-4: strength-stamina (approx. 40-60% of muscular force)

| sets | repetitions | break | speed of movement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 - 4 | 16 - 20 | 60 sec. | briskly |

Weeks 5-8: muscle training (approx. 60-80% of muscular force)

| sets | repetitions | break | speed of movement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 - 4 | 10 - 14 | 3 - 4 min. | moderately |

Always start your training session with a set of movements to warm up. Use intervals in exercising to loosen up. Exercise 2-3 times per week with your MULTIGYM PLUS and take every opportunity to increase your program of exercise, e.g. by taking long walks, jogging, cycling, swimming etc.
You will find that regular exercise increases your physical fitness as well as your feeling of general wellbeing.

__Caution!__

You are using a machine that has been designed and built to the latest safety standards. Any possible sources of danger that could lead to injury have been extensively eliminated. The machine is intended for use by adults only.

Wrong or excessive training can damage your health. Before commencing a course of fitness training, arrange for a medical check-up to see if you are in a state of health suited to training on the machine. The result
of the check-up should be used as a basis for your training programme.

The machine is never to be looked upon as a toy. Please remember that the nature of children who are using the machine can lead to unforeseen situations and hazards for which the manufacturer cannot be held liable.
If children are allowed to use the machine, they should be instructed on its correct use and dangerous situations explained to them.

The machine must be carefully assembled by an adult. It must be ensured that the machine is not used until it has been fully assembled.

When used for regular training/exercising, we recommend checking all parts of the machine (especially screws, nuts, bolts and ropes) every 1 to 2 months. So that the intended level of safety is maintained, the machine is to be taken out of use if any parts are worn. The worn parts are to be exchanged immediately.

__Note on Operation__

After using the leg curler, unhook the pulley rope to relieve the strain on it during other exercises and to prolong the life span of your MULTIGYM PLUS power machine.

*“Maximum individual strength“ is defined as the effort which you as an individual must exert to
 overcome
